	<br>Multiplying by Tens
</div>
<div>
	<br>When working beyond nine the counting is done in tens.
	<br>ten Tens is one Hundred.
	<br>ten Hundreds is one Thousand
	<br>ten Thousands is one Ten Thousand.
	<br>hundred Hundreds is one Ten Thousand.
	<br>
	<br>In terms of multiplication:
	<br><span class="number">10x10=100</span>
	<br><span class="number">10x100=1000</span>
	<br><span class="number">10x1000=10000</span>
	<br><span class="number">100x100=10x10x100=10x1000=10000</span>
	<br>
</div>
<div>
	<br>A technique when multiplying in tens, hundreds, thousands and so is is to count the trailing zeros.
	<br>Each <span class="number">0</span> positions the <span class="number">1</span> in the correct column
	<br>The number of <span class="number">0</span>s in the multiplication matches the number of <span class="number">0</span>s in the result;
</div>
<div>
	<br><span class="number">30x20 = 3x10x2x10 = 3x2x10x10 = 6x100 = 600</span> since multiplying order does not matter 
	<br>Using the counting <span class="number">0</span>s technique there are two trailing <span class="number">0</span>s in <span class="number">30x20</span> so two in answer
	<br>So calculate <span class="number">3x2 = 6</span> and apply the correct number of <span class="number">0</span>s (two) to position the <span class="number">6</span>
	<br>So <span class="number">30x20 = 600</span>
</div>
<div>
	<br>Another example
	<br><span class="number">500x70</span> 
	<br>Using the counting <span class="number">0</span>s technique there are three trailing <span class="number">0</span>s in <span class="number">500x70</span> so three in answer
	<br>So calculate <span class="number">5x7 = 35</span> and apply the correct number of <span class="number">0</span>s (three) to position the <span class="number">35</span>
	<br>So <span class="number">500x70 = 35000</span>
