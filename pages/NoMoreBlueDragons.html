	<br>Dragon Maths Without the Blue Dragons
</div>
<div>
	<br>Dragons are naturally dangerous and luckily unecessary to continue to do maths. 
	<br>First of all the treatise has shown that only red dragons are necessary since the actions of blue dragons can always be swapped with red dragons using a number stone of the opposite colour.

<div>
	<br><span class="number">5–3</span> represents
	<br><img src="images/num5.png"> <img src="images/take3.png">
	<br><img src="images/take3.png"> can be swapped with <img src="images/add-3.png"> 
	<br>with the result <img src="images/num5.png"> <img src='images/num-3.png'>
	<br>which is represented by <span class="number">5+(-3)</span>
</div>
<div>
	<br>The take away red Three can be changed to add blue Three
	<br>A take away requires a change to add and a swap of colour.
</div>
<div>
	 <br>Minus <span class="number">-</span> can also be read as swap.
	 <br><span class="number">3</span> represents <img src='images/num3.png'>
	 <br><span class="number">-3</span> represents <img src='images/num-3.png'>
	 <br>So Minus Three can be read as swap red Three for blue Three.
</div>
<div>
	<br>Reading <span class="number">-</span> as swap colour means that <span class="number">-(-3)</span> or Minus Minus Three represents <img src='images/num3.png'>
	<br><span class="number">3</span> represents <img src='images/num3.png'>
	<br><span class="number">-3</span> represents swap colour of <img src='images/num3.png'> to <img src='images/num-3.png'>
	<br><span class="number">-(-3)</span> represents two swaps, first swap from red to blue, <img src='images/num3.png'> to <img src='images/num-3.png'>, the second swapping the blue back to red, <img src='images/num-3.png'> to <img src='images/num3.png'>.
</div>
<div>
	<br>Consider <span class="number">2+(-1)–(-3)</span>
	<br>In terms of colour this is red add blue take away blue
	<br>Which becomes red add blue add swap blue
	<br>Which is red add blue add red
	<br>So <span class="number">2+(-1)–(-3)</span> becomes <span class="number">2+(-1)+3</span>
	<br>Put all the red (positive) numbers together and put all blue (negative) numbers together to give <span class="number">2+3+(-1) = 5 + (-1) = 4</span>
</div>
<div>
	<br>Red is always the starting colour.
	<br>Take away and minus signs are the two negative signs
	<br>One negative sign means one swap so the result is blue. [Odd number of these signs means blue number]
	<br>Two negative signs means two swaps so the result is red
	<br>In general 
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an odd number of negative signs applied together result in a blue number (negative number)
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspan even number of negative signs applied together result in a red number  (positive number)
</div>
<div>
	<br>This works for multiplication as well
	<br><span class="number">5 x 3 = 15</span> no minus signs so red (positive) No swaps
	<br><span class="number">5 x (-3) = (-15)</span> one minus sign so blue (negative) One swap : red to blue
	<br><span class="number">(-5) x 3 = (-15)</span> one minus sign so blue (negative) One swap : red to blue
	<br><span class="number">(-5) x (-3) = 15</span> two minus signs so red (positive) Two swaps : red to blue to red
