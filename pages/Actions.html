	<br>Actions and results
</div>
<div>
	<br>Usually actions and the results of actions are seen as completely different. This is also true in the Domain of Numbers. For example the actions of adding and taking away are separate and different from the results of these actions.</div>
<div>
	<br>The action adding One 
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/add1.png">
	<br>is different from the result
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/num1.png">
</div>
<div>
	<br>The action taking away One 
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/take1.png">
	<br>is different from the result
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/num-1.png">
</div>
<div>
	<br>The actions of adding Two then adding Three 
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/add2.png"><img class="dragon" src="images/add3.png">
	<br>is different from the action adding Five
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/add5.png">
	<br>yet both have the same result
	<br><img class="dragon" src="images/num5.png">
</div>
<div>
	<br>However when writing Mathematics actions and their results are often treated as the same thing and actions and their results are put to be equal.
	<br>In Mathematics 
	<br><span class="number">+2+3</span>
	<br><span class="number">2+3</span>
	<br><span class="number">+5</span>
	<br>are all different ways in which <span class="number">5</span> can be written as they all have the same result <span class="number">5</span>
	<br>Where actions have the same result they are equal and are equal to the result.
	<br><span class="number">+2+3 = 2+3 = +5 = 5</span>
</div>
<div>
	<br>In the above example it is well known that the actions <span class="number">+2+3</span> result in <span class="number">5.</span> 
	<br>Usually Mathematics deals with problems when the results of actions are not immediately clear
	<br>For example the result of <span class="number">+836 â€“357+187</span> can only be obtained by understanding and following the methods for adding and taking away large numbers.

<div>
	<br>It is very important to learn the methods for obtaining results from actions. Learning these methods is learning arithmetic.
