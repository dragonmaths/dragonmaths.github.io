	<br>Taking Away, Minus, Negative and Other Words
</div>
<div>
	<br>In this treatise <span class="number">(-1)</span> is called Minus One and is a result. 
	<br>The action <span class="number">–</span> is called taking away.
	<br>On the Taking Away page and equating actions with results it was shown that the action Taking Away One and the result Minus One are equivalent.
	<br>Often in Maths rather than taking away, minus is used as the same action  as in <span class="number">5</span> minus <span class="number">3</span> is <span class="number">2</span>
	<br>Hence <span class="number">–(-1)</span> is often said as minus minus one.
	<br>In this case strictly the two uses of minus are different - the first is an action (taking away) the second as part of a name of a number (Minus One)
</div>
<div>
	<br>Why the name Minus One in the first place?
	<br>Well when minus is used for the action taking away and since <span class="number">–1 = -1</span> then minus (the action) One gives a result which is called Minus One from the action that led to it.
	<br><span class="number">-1</span> could have been called Taking Away One but that would have been a bit of a mouthful.
	<br>In proper mathematical circles <span class="number">-1</span> is called Negative One and taking away is called subtract.
</div>
<div>
	<br>There is another way to think of Minus One using Minus as a different action (which is taking the negative)
	<br><span class="number">1</span> is <img src='images/num1.png'> and is red.
	<br><span class="number">(-1)</span> is <img src='images/num-1.png'> and is blue.
	<br>Minus can be thought of as the action swap colours. So red goes to blue and blue to red.
	<br><span class="number">(-1)</span> can be thought of as start with the number One (red) and swap it for blue.
	<br>So Minus One is the (blue) number obtained when the (red) number One is switched to blue.
</div>
<div>
	<br>Using Minus to mean swap then
	<br>Minus Minus One could mean start with One (red) swap (first Minus) to Minus One (blue) and then swap (second Minus) to red which is One.
	<br>Minus Minus One could mean start with Minus One (blue) and swap (second Minus) to red which is One. Same result
	<br>So <span class="number">-(-1) = –(-1) = 1</span>
	<br>So Minus Minus One, take away Minus One and One are taken as the same equating actions and results.
