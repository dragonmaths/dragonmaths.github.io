	<br>What is Minus One?
</div>
<div>
	<br>In the very unlikely event of finding yourself in the Magical Domain of Numbers you will find that Minus One is an extremely bright body of gleaming, flowing ice shimmering shades of luminescence blue shot through with glimmering white. In this work, for brevity, it will be referred to unflatteringly as a blue stone or even shorter as a blue one. [For a description of the Domain of Numbers read 'A Deceit of Numbers']	</div>
<div>
	<br>One, <span class="number">(-1) </span> or <span class="number">-1</span>, is used to represent one blue stone <img src="images/num-1.png">
</div>
<div>
	<br><span class="number"> +(-1)</span> or <span class="number">+-1</span>  represents a red dragon adding one blue stone

</div>
<div>
	<br>Treating actions and results as the same :- <span class="number">(-1) = -1 = +(-1) = +-1</span>  
	<br>Note: <span class="number">+-1</span> should never be used. ‘Add Minus One’ should always be written as <span class="number">+(-1)</span> this stops the minus sign getting lost.
